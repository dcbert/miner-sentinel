tagline: Unified monitoring dashboard for BitAxe and Avalon Bitcoin miners
description: >-
  MinerSentinel is a self-hosted monitoring solution designed for Bitcoin home miners
  running BitAxe and Avalon Nano 3s ASIC devices. It provides a centralized dashboard
  to track performance, health, and profitability metrics across your entire mining fleet.


  **Real-Time Device Monitoring**

  Monitor hashrate, temperature, power consumption, and efficiency for each device.
  Visual status indicators show online/offline state and hardware health at a glance.


  **Multi-Device Fleet Management**

  Add unlimited BitAxe and Avalon miners through a simple web interface. Dynamic device
  management allows adding or removing devices without service restarts. Each device
  displays individual statistics with drill-down detail views.


  **Pool Integration**

  Native support for CKPool and Public Pool solo mining statistics. Track your best shares,
  worker counts, and pool-side hashrate. View historical difficulty submissions and
  probability calculations for solo block discovery.


  **Advanced Analytics**

  Visualize performance trends with interactive charts. Compare efficiency across devices,
  analyze power consumption patterns, and predict maintenance needs. Time-series data
  stored in PostgreSQL enables historical trend analysis.


  **Intelligent Alerts**

  Telegram integration delivers instant notifications for critical events. Receive alerts
  for device offline status, hashrate stagnation, and new best difficulty achievements.
  Automatic device restart attempts when stagnation is detected.


  **Built for Self-Sovereignty**

  Runs entirely on your own hardware with no external dependencies. All data stays local.
  Designed for Umbrel with Docker containerization for easy deployment and updates.
